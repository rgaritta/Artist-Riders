# About

This was my capstone project for the UCF Coding Bootcamp -- it is a full stack MERN web application that accepts an upload of a file (an artist rider in this case) and stores the file in a Cloudinary cloud storage location. The uploaded file is then pinned to the account of the user who is logged in. You can retrieve your uploaded files by logging in.
